        <p>ScenicOrNot was a mySociety project running from 2009 to 2015, created
        with help from our friends at The Dextrous Web. Users were served a
        series of images from around the country, and invited to rate them on a
        scale of 1-10.</p>

        <p>The result of this game was a crowd-sourced database, giving an
        aggregate ‘scenicness’ rating for every square kilometre of Great
        Britain.</p>

        <p>ScenicOrNot helped to prove the concept of crowd-sourcing, and the
        idea that, if you make a task compelling enough, people will flock to
        contribute &mdash; a concept now commonly called ‘gamification’. We believe
        it was, at the time, unprecedented as a piece of crowd-sourced geodata
        about a whole country.</p>

        <h2>Why we don't run this site ourselves any more</h2>

        <p>ScenicOrNot was one of several useful, open source sites conceived
        and run by mySociety, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/projects/">many
            of which</a> continue to flourish. In 2015, with
        regret, we made the tough decision to turn our focus to running our
        core sites and providing support to international partners.
